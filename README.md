# Financial Crisis Early Warning System

## Overview
An advanced deep learning system that predicts financial market crisis risks by analyzing:

### Text Data:
- Financial News Articles
- Company Performance Reports
- Market Commentary
- Economic Indicators Analysis
- Trading Pattern Reports

### Market Data:
- Market Performance Metrics
- Volatility Indicators
- Trading Volume
- Market Momentum Signals
- Stability Measures

The system processes these inputs through a neural architecture to classify financial risk into 5 distinct levels, from stable conditions to crisis scenarios.

## Data Features
### Text Analysis:
- Sentiment Analysis of Financial News
- Key Performance Indicator Extraction
- Market Sentiment Patterns
- Risk Signal Detection from Financial Reports
- Economic Trend Analysis

### Market Indicators:
- Performance Trend Analysis
- Volatility Pattern Recognition
- Trading Volume Analysis
- Market Stability Metrics
- Risk Level Indicators

## Model Architecture
- Text Processing: DistilBERT-based encoder for financial text analysis
- Market Data Processing: Custom neural network for market indicator analysis
- Data Fusion: Advanced attention mechanism combining text and market features
- Output: 5-level risk classification with uncertainty estimation

## Technical Highlights
- PyTorch Lightning implementation
- Multi-modal fusion architecture
- Uncertainty-aware predictions
- Wandb integration for experiment tracking
- Distributed training support
- MPS/GPU acceleration support
